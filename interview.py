# Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is
# defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say,
# Ruby). This means that if you use a mutable default argument and
# mutate it, you will and have mutated that object for all future calls
# to the function as well.
# Solution:
>>> def append_to(element, to=None):
...     if to is None:
...         to = []
...     to.append(element)
...     return to
